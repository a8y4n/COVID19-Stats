# COVID19-Stats
This is an app which I made in 12th Grade as an investigatory project for Python-SQL project.
To run this app properly, make sure all the files are stored in the same directory.

Create a database with the SQL file and then import the content from the file provided in this repository.
Further info is provided in the code and the app itself.
Enjoy!
